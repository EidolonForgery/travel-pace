# travel-pace
A simple module that calculates the travel time for D&amp;D5e players. it's just a module I'm using to learn how to make modules for foundry.

- Use the information described in pg.84 of the OGL as a calculation rule.
- (tips) Use the lowest speed of the group in feet as a reference.
- (tips) It is implicit that you consider any terrain that does not consist of a road or trail as difficult terrain.

# Future Improvements
This module is being developed at the beginning as a way of learning, so the improvements should take time to appear.
Collaborations are always welcome.
And I'm thinking of ways to improve the module using the foundry measurement guide to feed the measured values as the player measures the map.
And find a way to integrate the "about-time" module to advance the time if necessary.
